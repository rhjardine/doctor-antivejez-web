        'Increase the consumption of foods rich in omega-3s such as salmon, sole, cauliflower, etc.',
        'Reduce the amount of sodium (particularly present in cooking salt) because it inhibits the levels of adiponectin, a natural inflammation inhibitor.',
        'Reduce the amount of protein and excessive calorie intake to prevent premature aging.',
        'Take the recommended daily amount of vitamins B6, B12, folate, C and E. Low levels of B vitamins are closely associated with premature shortening of telomeres and an increased risk of developing age-related diseases;vitamins C and E are powerful antioxidants that preserve telomere length.',
